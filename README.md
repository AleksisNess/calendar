This is a program that displays a calendar based on the specified year and date.
I'm not sure why it's useful, it's just fun. Maybe someone will need it.
to start working with the project, you can simply copy the code from the file: calendar.py
I don't think you need any help with the project, because it's very simple. If anything, read the documentation :)
